## 👤 User Stories

### 1. Parents and Children

Parents create a list of tasks (e.g., homework, chores) for their child. The child can view tasks in their interface and mark them as "Done" when completed. Parents are notified when tasks are finished.

### 2. Elderly and Caregiver

A son or daughter creates a reminder task (e.g., take medicine, check blood pressure) for their elderly parent. The system sends a timely reminder to the parent, who confirms completion by marking the task as done.

### 3. Couples

One spouse assigns a reminder to the other (e.g., "buy gardening supplies after work"). The system delivers a reminder during the appropriate time window, ensuring the task is not forgotten and reducing miscommunication.
